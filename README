This script will scan through the subdirectories of a directory that
you specify. If those subdirectories contain a video file, and that video
file accounts for 90% or more of the directory's size, the script will
delete everything else in that directory.

This is particularly useful for cleaning up after a torrent has been
downloaded. It will delete stupid nfo files, sample files, readme files,
etc, and leave you with just the video.
